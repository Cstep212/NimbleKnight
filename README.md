Liberate your King's Castle from the Hellish Demon Lord but you'll have to be quick or you and everyone else shall perish!!

Genre: Auto-scroller, Platformer, Hack'n Slash

Audience: Beginner to Intermediate Players

Theme: Fantasy, Medieval

Goals: Vanquish evil spirits and the Demon Lord to gain points and win the game!

Uniqueness: Replayable level to get better at defeating more monsters to gain more points to improve all time highscore.

Game Vision: I wanted to try to make a game that had more mechanics and would be more challenging to make than just an ordinary arcade game. So I decided to create a platformer because I personally find them enjoyable. It wasn't until the last minute that I decided to make it an auto-scroller instead of a normal platformer where the camera moves with the player. I also wanted to make the gameplay more challenging by adding monsters and a final boss.

# Bugs

- Letting go of either run buttons while holding an arrow key makes the player keep running.

- Jumping instead of walking off the edge to the Boss lair breaks the camera.

- Frame issues need to be fixed (Some are glitchy looking)

- Hitboxes need to be adjusted if wanting to be more accurate

# NOTE

Additional frames are included that aren't implemented yet but will be expecting to implement them at a later date. (These were not in my original scope)
